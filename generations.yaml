generations:
  - name: "First Generation (R50/R53)"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The first-generation MINI Hardtop marked BMW's revival of the iconic British brand, reimagining the classic Mini with modern technology while maintaining its distinctive character. Available as the Cooper (R50) with a 1.6-liter Tritec engine producing 115 horsepower and the performance-oriented Cooper S (R53) with a supercharged 1.6-liter developing 163-170 horsepower. The exterior design successfully translated the original Mini's iconic styling cues—including round headlights, floating roof, minimal overhangs, and wheels pushed to the corners—into a larger, modern package that met contemporary safety standards. The interior featured a unique retro-futuristic design with a large central speedometer, toggle switches, and circular theme throughout. Despite growing significantly compared to the classic Mini, the R50/R53 maintained relatively compact dimensions by modern standards and delivered the nimble handling that became known as the 'go-kart feel.' Features unusual for a small car at the time included a multilink rear suspension, optional run-flat tires, stability control, and various luxury amenities more commonly found in premium vehicles. Extensive customization options were a hallmark of the model, with numerous color combinations, graphics packages, and accessories allowing personalization. The first-generation established the reborn MINI as a premium small car with character and performance appeal beyond its practical attributes."

  - name: "Second Generation (R56)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation MINI Hardtop evolved the design established by its predecessor with subtle refinements to styling and significant mechanical updates. Slightly larger than the first generation, it featured a longer front overhang to meet pedestrian safety regulations, redesigned lighting elements, and refreshed interior. Powertrain options included a new 1.6-liter Prince engine co-developed with PSA Peugeot Citroën, producing 118 horsepower in naturally aspirated form for the Cooper, while the Cooper S switched from supercharging to turbocharging, generating 172 horsepower (later increased to 181 hp). The interior maintained MINI's distinctive design elements but with improved ergonomics, material quality, and technology options including an enhanced navigation system, Bluetooth connectivity, and USB integration. The chassis was retuned to preserve MINI's hallmark handling while improving ride comfort and refinement. New features included keyless ignition, ambient lighting, and an electronic limited-slip differential for improved traction. High-performance John Cooper Works models became fully integrated factory variants rather than dealer-installed packages, offering up to 208 horsepower and enhanced chassis components. A minor refresh in 2011 brought updated styling details, refined engines with improved efficiency, and expanded technology options. This generation refined the MINI formula with increased sophistication and efficiency while maintaining the brand's distinctive character."

  - name: "Third Generation (F56)"
    start_year: 2014
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The third-generation MINI Hardtop represented a more substantial redesign, built on BMW's new UKL1 front-wheel-drive platform shared with several BMW models. Notably larger than its predecessors, it grew in length, width, and wheelbase to improve passenger space and crash protection. Powertrains were completely revised, with the base Cooper featuring a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 134 horsepower, while the Cooper S utilized a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 189 horsepower. Both engines incorporated BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology for improved efficiency and performance. The exterior design evolved with more rounded forms, larger headlights with available LED technology, a more prominent grille, and more substantial proportions overall. The interior received a significant modernization with a more conventional instrument cluster positioned behind the steering wheel, a separate 6.5-inch (later 8.8-inch) infotainment display, and higher quality materials throughout. Technology advanced considerably with options including head-up display, active cruise control, collision and pedestrian warning systems, parking assistant, and enhanced connectivity features. A 4-door hardtop variant was introduced for the first time in 2015, offering improved rear passenger access and space. A refreshed version was introduced in 2018 with updated styling, improved technology including front and rear LED lights with distinctive Union Jack patterned taillights, and new customization options. The all-electric Cooper SE joined the lineup in 2020, offering 181 horsepower and approximately 110 miles of EPA-rated range. This generation maintained MINI's distinctive character while delivering more refinement, technology, and practicality."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (J01)"
    start_year: 2024
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation MINI Hardtop introduces a new design language and platform strategy, with distinct combustion-engine (internal designation J01) and electric (J01E) variants sharing styling but different underpinnings. The exterior design returns to a cleaner, more minimalist aesthetic inspired by the original Mini, featuring a rounded silhouette, shorter overhangs, simplified surfaces, and a more vertical front end. The iconic circular headlights remain but are framed in more rectangular outlines. The gasoline-powered models retain an evolution of the previous platform with updated powertrains, while the electric variants utilize a new dedicated EV architecture developed jointly with Great Wall Motor. The Cooper features a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder producing 156 horsepower, and the Cooper S utilizes a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder generating 201 horsepower, both paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. The electric Cooper SE offers two battery options with up to 250 miles of range and 218 horsepower in the higher-output version. The interior receives a dramatic reimagining with a minimalist dashboard dominated by a large round 9.4-inch OLED touchscreen that incorporates most vehicle functions, with physical controls limited to a toggle bar for essential features. New technology includes augmented reality navigation, advanced driver assistance systems, and a sophisticated ambient lighting system that extends across the dashboard. The new Hardtop represents MINI's transition toward electrification while maintaining combustion options, balancing the brand's heritage with modern technology and sustainability objectives while keeping its distinctive character and focus on driving enjoyment."
